# WeightTracker Mobile App

## Overview

### Needs and Objectives
The purpose of the WeightTracker app is to assist users in efficiently tracking their weight loss progress. The main objective was to develop an intuitive application that would allow users to set personal objectives, track daily weight inputs, and track their progress using graphs and analytics. The software fills a need for a feature-rich weight management tracking tool that also offers motivational insights derived from user data.

### Requirements for Users
The software was made to make it simple to register daily weight entries, set and monitor weight loss objectives, see progress through graphs, and get encouraging advice. It also guarantees the efficient and safe management of personal data.

## Displays and Functionalities

The software has multiple important screens: the Home Screen, which shows a summary of progress, the Login Screen, which provides safe access; the Weight Log Screen, which allows users to record weight loss data every day; the Progress Graph Screen, which shows weight loss data visually; and the Settings Screen, which allows for account management and customization.

User login, goal-setting, weight entry, progress visualization, and notifications are some of the important features. An engaging user experience is produced by the user-centric UI design, which places a strong 
## Process of Development

Modular code, utilizing ViewModels and LiveData on Android, building Room Database for local storage, and using Jetpack Compose for the UI were all part of the development process. Future projects will benefit from the well-organized and scalable codebase that these strategies ensured.

To verify functioning, a great deal of testing was done, including unit, integration, and user testing. This procedure is essential for finding and resolving defects, guaranteeing that the app functions as intended, and raising user satisfaction.

## Difficulties and Creativity

User participation and data synchronization presented major difficulties. Using alerts and motivational advice, as well as guaranteeing data consistency across screens, were examples of creative solutions.

A particularly effective component that improved the user experience and showcased real-time data visualization was the progress graph.

## Final Thoughts

The process of developing the WeightTracker app offered a thorough educational opportunity. By concentrating on user-centered design, strong development methods, and extensive testing, the project effectively met user needs and provided insightful information for upcoming app development projects.
